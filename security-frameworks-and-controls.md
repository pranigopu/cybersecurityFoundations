## Components of Security Frameworks
- **Identifying and documenting** security goals
- **Setting guidelines to achieve** security goals
- **Implementing** security processes
- **Monitoring and communicating** results

## Specific Frameworks
### CIA Triad
**CIA**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Accessibility
