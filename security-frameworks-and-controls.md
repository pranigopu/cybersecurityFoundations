Different security frameworks manage different types of:

- Organisational risks
- Regulatory compliance risks

---

The purpose of security frameworks include:

- Protecting personally identifiable information (PII)
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organizational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

## Components of Security Frameworks
- **Identifying and documenting** security goals
- **Setting guidelines to achieve** security goals
- **Implementing** security processes
- **Monitoring and communicating** results

## Specific Frameworks
### CIA Triad
CIA = Confidentiality, Integrity, Accessibility

---

_This is a foundational cybersecurity framework._

<details>
<summary>Confidentiality</summary>
<p>
Of identity, data and information about operations and assets.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integrity</summary>
<p>
Of data and assets. This involves:
<ul>
    <li>Protecting assets from damage</li>
    <li>Protecting data from unwanted/unauthorised* changes</li>
</ul>
*<i>May be intentional or accidental.</i>
<br><br>
<b><i>In short, data is correct, authentic, and reliable.</i></b>
