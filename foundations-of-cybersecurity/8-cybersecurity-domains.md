Familiarizing yourself with these domains will allow you to:

- Navigate the complex world of security
- Outline and organise how a team of security professionals works

Security roles may:

- Sit at the intersection of multiple domains
- Focus on one specific domain

Knowing where a given role fits within the security landscape:

- Helps you prepare for job interviews
- Helps you work as part of a full security team

# Security and Risk Management
- Define security goals (short-term and/or long-term)
- Risk mitigation (policies and procedures)
- Compliance (legal and/or ethical)
- Business continuity (maintaining business amid risks/attacks)

# Asset Security
- Secure digital and physical assets
- Also related to:
    - Data storage
    - Data and asset maintenance
    - Data and asset retention
    - Data and asset destruction
- **NOTE**: A key kind of data is confidential data

E.g.: Ensure old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed.

# Security Architecture and Engineering
Optimise data security by ensuring...

- Effective tools
- Effective systems
- Effective processes

... are in place.

E.g.: Configure a firewall.

# Communication and Network Security
Manage and secure:

- Physical networks
- Wireless communications

E.g.:

- Analyse user behavior within your organization
- Create and implement a network usage policy

# Identity and Access Management
Ensure users follow established policies to control and manage:

- Physical assets, like office spaces, servers and centres
- Logical assets, such as networks and applications

The goal of this: **to keep data secure**.

E.g.:

- Validate the identities of employees
- Document access roles

# Security Assessment and Testing
- Conduct security control testing
- Collect and analyse data
- Conduct security audits to monitor for:
    - Risks
    - Threats
    - Vulnerabilities

E.g.: Conduct regular audits of user permissions.

# Security Operations
Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

E.g.: Follow policies and procedures to stop potential threats.

# Software Development Security
Use secure coding practices.

**DEFINITION: Coding Practice**:

Recommended guidelines used to create secure applications/services.
