# Key Concepts
## Asset
An item (physical/digital/abstract) perceived as having value\*.

\* _To an organisation._

## Threat
Any circumstance/event/actor that can negatively impact assets.

---

Common threats:

- Insider threats <br> _Actors who abused authorised access_
- Advanced persistent threats <br> _Actors who keep unauthorised access for extended time-periods_

## Risk
The magnitude and likelihood of harm caused by a threat. Hence:

- Low magnitude and high likelihood may be medium-to-low risk
- High magnitude and low likelihood may be high-to-medium risk
- Low magnitude and low likelihood is low risk
- High magnitude and high likelihood is high risk

---

Hence, a risk anything that can impact the...

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

... of an asset.

### Low-Risk Asset
Publicly-exposed asset that presents little-to-know risk, e.g.:

- Public website information
- Published research papers

### Medium-Risk Asset
Non-publicly-exposed asset that presents risk if exposed, e.g.:

- Quarterly earnings (could affect stock prices)
- Employee email IDs

### High-Risk Asset
Non-publicly-exposed asset protected by law/regulation, e.g.:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Sensitive PII (SPII)
- Financial account information
- Systems access information
- Intellectual property (could give competitors unfair advantage)

## Vulnerability
A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

---

**NOTE**: Vulnerability + Threat -> Risk

Hence, **both** must be present for there to be a risk.

## Need for Precision in these Concepts
These concepts delineate specific areas that need specific kinds of actions and action-frameworks to effectively deal with situations involving these areas. For example, a threat must be countered (either actively or using existing defenses), a risk must prepared for (e.g. by establishing protocols) and a vulnerability must be fixed (e.g. by upgrading security measures). Thus, it is key to be precise about these concepts to be precise about what action would be most effective.

# Other Relevant Concepts
## Security Posture
An organisation's ability to:

- Manage its defense of critical assets and data
- React to change

## Social Engineering
Method of exploiting of human error to gain:

- Private information
- Access
- Valuables 

## Shared Responsibility
The idea that all within an organisation take an active role in:

- Lowering risk
- Maintaining both physical and virtual security

**NOTE**: _Is a concept in security architecture and engineering._
