# 1. Prepare
Manage security and privacy risks before they materialise.

# 2. Categorise

# 7. Monitor

---

- Assessing and maintaining technical operations are daily tasks
- Keeping risk at low levels involves validating current systems <br> _This means_...
    - Knowing how they support the organisation's security goals
    - Making changes (if needed) if systems do not meet these goals
