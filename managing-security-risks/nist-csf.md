# 1. Identify
Identify potential security issues.

# 2. Protect
Implementation...

- policies
- procedures
- training
- tools

... that help mitigate cybersecurity issues.

# 3. Detect
- Identifying potential security incidents
- Improving monitoring capabilities <br> _To increase the efficiency of detections_

---

This is different from the [identify](#1-identify) component:

- "Identify" focuses on issues that may materialise later:
    - Threats
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Risks
- "Detect" focuses on:
    - Conclusively identifying potential incidents:
        - Possible ongoing attacks
        - Possible ongoing breach/leakage of information
    - The ability to conclusively identify potential incidents:
        - Improve monitoring capabilities
        - Identify incident indicators

**NOTE**: _Detection works to conclusively identify incidents._ 

# 4. Respond
- Contain, neutralise, and analyse security incidents
- Implement improvements to the security process <br> _Improve the ability to respond to security incidents_

---

Follows the [Detect](#3-detect) step upon conclusive incident identification.

# 5. Recover
Returning affected systems back to normal operation, i.e.:

- Restoring affected assets
- Recovering lost information

# 6. Govern
Establishing and maintaining structures and processes...

... _to effectively manage cybersecurity risk._

# Summary
The above 6 functions can involve both proactive to reactive measures (most, except for [Identify](#1-identify) and [Govern](#6-govern)). All 6 functions are essential for making sure that an organization has effective security strategies in place. _Security incidents are going to happen, but an organisation must have the ability to quickly recover from any damage caused by an incident to minimise their level of risk._

# NIST Special Publication (SP 800-53)
NIST CSF also expands into the protection of the US federal government. The expansion of NIST CSF for this purpose is the NIST special publication, or SP 800-53. SP 800-53 is crucial if you have an interest in working for the US federal government.
