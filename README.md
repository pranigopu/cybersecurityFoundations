# Useful Resources
- [_Glossary_, **Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)**](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary)

# Cybersecurity: Definition and Purpose
The practice of ensuring:

<details>
<summary>Confidentiality</summary>
<p>
Of identity, data and information about operations and assets.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integrity</summary>
<p>
Of data and assets. This involves:
<ul>
    <li>Protecting assets from damage</li>
    <li>Protecting data from unwanted/unauthorised* changes</li>
</ul>
*<i>May be intentional or accidental.</i>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Availability</summary>
<p>
Of networks, data and assets. This means:
<ul>
    <li>Facilitating access where appropriate/authorised</li>
    <li>Protection against access-prevention methods*</li>
</ul>
*<i>Such as DDOS attacks, ransomware, etc.</i>
</p>
</details>

The above 3 make up the CIA triad (see: [_CIA Triad_, **GeeksForGeeks.org**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-cia-triad-in-cryptography/)).

# Key Skills for Cybersecurity
## Transferrable skills
Skills from other areas that can apply more broadly.

<details>
<summary>Communication</summary>
<p>
Security requires proper usage and diverse competencies. Hence: 
<ul>
    <li>Communicate and collaborate with others<br><i>Security frameworks + operations have multiple moving parts</i></li>
    <li>Understanding others' questions or concerns<br><i>Especially for stakeholders, users and key decision makers</i></li>
    <li>Communicating information clearly to individuals<br><i>With technical and non-technical knowledge</i></li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem-solving</summary>
<p>
It is key to proactively identify and solve problems. Hence:
<ul>
    <li>Recognise attack patterns</li>
    <li>Determine efficient risk-minimising solutions</li>
    <li>Try creative/unprecedented approaches</li>
    <li>Grasp trade-offs in various potential solutions</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Time management</summary>
<p>
Sense of urgency and effective task-prioritisation is key.
<ul>
    <li>Threats can escalate quickly</li>
    <li>Security requirements are time-sensitive</li>
</ul>
<i>Risks, threats and damage do not wait for you to catch up!</i>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Growth mindset</summary>
<p>
Technologies, techniques and use-cases evolve; so must you.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Diverse perspectives</summary>
<p>
Focus cannot grasp everything at once; utilise other perspectives!
</p>
</details>

# 2 Sides of Cybersecurity
**1. Operation-side**:

Responding to detections and doing investigations.

**2. Project-side**:

Working with other teams to:

- Build new detections
- Improve the current detections

---

Difference between entry-level cybersecurity analyst and engineer:

- Analyst is more focused on the operation-side
- Engineer are more focused on the project-side <br> _While they can do operations_
